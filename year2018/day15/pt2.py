--- Part Two ---

According to your calculations, the Elves are going to lose badly. Surely, you won't mess up the timeline too much if you give them just a little advanced technology, right?

You need to make sure the Elves not only win, but also suffer no losses: even the death of a single Elf is unacceptable.

However, you can't go too far: larger changes will be more likely to permanently alter spacetime.

So, you need to find the outcome of the battle in which the Elves have the lowest integer attack power (at least 4) that allows them to win without a single death. The Goblins always have an attack power of 3.

In the first summarized example above, the lowest attack power the Elves need to win without losses is 15:

#######       #######
#.G...#       #..E..#   E(158)
#...EG#       #...E.#   E(14)
#.#.#G#  -->  #.#.#.#
#..G#E#       #...#.#
#.....#       #.....#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 29 full rounds
Elves win with 172 total hit points left
Outcome: 29 * 172 = 4988

In the second example above, the Elves need only 4 attack power:

#######       #######
#E..EG#       #.E.E.#   E(200), E(23)
#.#G.E#       #.#E..#   E(200)
#E.##E#  -->  #E.##E#   E(125), E(200)
#G..#.#       #.E.#.#   E(200)
#..E#.#       #...#.#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 33 full rounds
Elves win with 948 total hit points left
Outcome: 33 * 948 = 31284

In the third example above, the Elves need 15 attack power:

#######       #######
#E.G#.#       #.E.#.#   E(8)
#.#G..#       #.#E..#   E(86)
#G.#.G#  -->  #..#..#
#G..#.#       #...#.#
#...E.#       #.....#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 37 full rounds
Elves win with 94 total hit points left
Outcome: 37 * 94 = 3478

In the fourth example above, the Elves need 12 attack power:

#######       #######
#.E...#       #...E.#   E(14)
#.#..G#       #.#..E#   E(152)
#.###.#  -->  #.###.#
#E#G#G#       #.#.#.#
#...#G#       #...#.#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 39 full rounds
Elves win with 166 total hit points left
Outcome: 39 * 166 = 6474

In the last example above, the lone Elf needs 34 attack power:

#########       #########
#G......#       #.......#
#.E.#...#       #.E.#...#   E(38)
#..##..G#       #..##...#
#...##..#  -->  #...##..#
#...#...#       #...#...#
#.G...G.#       #.......#
#.....G.#       #.......#
#########       #########

Combat ends after 30 full rounds
Elves win with 38 total hit points left
Outcome: 30 * 38 = 1140

After increasing the Elves' attack power until it is just barely enough for them to win without any Elves dying, what is the outcome of the combat described in your puzzle input?
